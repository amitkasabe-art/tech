<!-- html is a Hyper Text Markup Language it's not a programming language because it can't take input and provide output as we used to do in c where we used to use scanf() for taking input from user
we can't write logic in html.
we can't use anything which can build user interative application 

Hyper Text Markup Language means
Hyper Text -> text that connects to another text 
which means when we click on 
-->
<a href="https://www.google.com"></a>
<!-- 
    we redirect to google.com it means it is a hyper text which is connected to google.
    it is not only about external website , it can be related to any word or any local page.
 -->

 <!-- 
    markup language -> a language which is enclosed within tags.
    a tag looks like this - <tag>This is a tag</tag>
  -->

  <!-- let's see how we can define basic structre of html which is commonly used in each html code  -->
  <html> <!-- this is a opening html tag everything will be considered adocument which is written in this tag -->
      <head><!-- this is head of the document type where further things like javascript and css(internal) can be written -->
          <title>This is a title</title> <!-- this tag defines title of the web page or document-->
      </head>
      <body> <!-- This is the body tag in which all html is written in html-->
          
      </body>
  </html>
